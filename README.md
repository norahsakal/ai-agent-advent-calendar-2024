# üéÑ AI Advent Calendar 2024: 24 Days of AI Agent Challenges in Online Retail

Welcome to the **AI Agent Advent Calendar 2024**, a daily exploration of how **AI agents** can transform online retail by addressing the limitations of naive chatbots.

## üìñ About This Series

Every day in December, I'll publish a new Jupyter Notebook highlighting a common challenge faced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots and demonstrating how **AI agents** overcome these obstacles.  

Through code, visualizations, and step-by-step explanations, you'll learn how to build smarter AI systems for your e-commerce applications.

### What You'll Find Here
- **Daily Challenges**: Each notebook addresses a specific chatbot limitation, such as:
  - Asking clarifying questions
  - Maintaining multi-turn conversation context
  - Personalizing recommendations
- **Hands-On Notebooks**: Ready-to-run Jupyter Notebooks with detailed walkthroughs
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Practical examples tailored to online retail, complete with code snippets, diagrams, and agent workflows

### üåü Featured Day 1 Challenge:
**How AI Agents Improve Naive Chatbots by Asking Clarifying Questions**  
- Discover how AI agents enhance user interactions by interpreting ambiguous queries and dynamically refining results.

### üõç Meet SoleMates

**SoleMates** is our fictional online shoe store and the foundation for this series.  

I've designed SoleMates to illustrate real-world e-commerce challenges, focusing on interactions between customers and chatbots. Using SoleMates' fictional shoe catalog, we'll explore the differences between naive chatbot systems and advanced AI agents.

### Included Data and Assets:
- **CSV Files**: Contains product data for SoleMates, including product titles, categories, and metadata
- **Footwear Images**: A set of images representing SoleMates' products, used in visualization tasks

These assets are included in the repo to ensure you can follow along with each challenge seamlessly.

### ‚ú® Why This Matters
Naive chatbots often fail to meet customer expectations in dynamic e-commerce environments. 

By adopting AI agents, you can:

- Enhance customer experience with smarter, context-aware interactions
- Increase conversion rates with tailored recommendations
- Build scalable systems that adapt to complex queries effortlessly
