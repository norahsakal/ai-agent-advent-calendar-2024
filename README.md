## 📖 About This Series

Every day in December, I'll publish a new Jupyter Notebook highlighting a common challenge faced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots and demonstrating how **AI agents** overcome these obstacles.  

Through code, visualizations, and step-by-step explanations, you'll learn how to build smarter AI systems for your e-commerce applications.

### What You'll Find Here

### 🛍 Meet SoleMates

**SoleMates** is our fictional online shoe store and the foundation for this series.  

I've designed SoleMates to illustrate real-world e-commerce challenges, focusing on interactions between customers and chatbots. Using SoleMates' fictional shoe catalog, we'll explore the differences between naive chatbot systems and advanced AI agents.
